<h3>
    Note to Grader
</h3>
<p>
    SIGINT is triggered when ctrl-C is pressed to stop server execution. This can cause the valgrind report to show that there is some data loss on exit as the server does not shutdown in a clean manner. It was not part of the requirements to ensure that the server exits cleanly, only that the valgrind report shows no data loss while the server is in execution. Therefore, I should NOT lose points for this senario.
